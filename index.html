                    <h2>About Me </h2>
                    <p>Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a renowned theoretical physicist who is best known for his theory
                        of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. He was born
                        in Germany and later became a naturalized Swiss and American citizen. In 1905, he published his
                        famous equation, E=mc², which demonstrated the equivalence of energy and mass. Einstein's work
                        laid the foundation for many scientific advancements and had a profound impact on the
                        development of modern physics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his
                        contributions to the field, but his enduring legacy goes beyond his scientific achievements, as
                        he also spoke out on issues of social justice, pacifism, and human rights. Albert Einstein
                        remains an iconic figure in the history of science and an inspiration to many.

                    <p>I used to spend hours playing the violin while he goes bird- watching. He said, “I often think in
                        music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music”, also “I know that the
                        most joy in my life has come to me from my violin. And also i love walking in the streets”</p>
